# Agify and Genderize a Name!
## Code Institute Client-side Javascript portfolio project
[Live site here](https://doctorandrewbrown.github.io/ageify/)
* This app is called "Agify and Genderize a Name!". The app allows people to enter a name and country and have the average age and the gender for that name in that country to be displayed in an attractive user-interface. 
* The app allows users to interact with two free api services, [Ageify](https://agify.io/) and [Genderize](https://genderize.io/).
* The app provides an HTML/CSS interface and the javascript logic needed for users to consume data provided by the two above api services. The user enters a name and country and the app sends the user input to the two apis, processes the data returned and presents the results in an attractive interface.
* Additional data obtained from the apis and available through the app, is the probability of the gender given and the population sizes from which the age and gender statistics are calculated.
    
* The site is intended for fun, for people curious about the age group into which a name falls and also the proportion of males and females having certain names. An example use might involve questions like "how many people named Ashley in the UK are male?", for instance.
  
* The app allows easy comparison of multiple results presented in a list form in an attractive interface. 

## UX
* Design was kept simple including only the features required to get user input, submit a query, display a results list, and remove unwanted results from the display.
* The only user controls needed were an input field for users to input any name, an input select list to choose from a hard-coded list of country options, and a submit button. This approach allows flexibility and ease of use while keeping errors to a minimum. 
* Simple clear user instructions are provided in label elements attached to the input elements.
*  The interface also has the feature that unwanted results can be removed from the display list by clicking. This functionality is indicated to the user via a simple  message in the interface. 
* Ease of use is also supported by using placeholder text in input fields and use of the onfocus attribute in the "name" input element.
* The required "country" input is facilitated with a hard-coded select option dropdown menu with the default value set to "United Kingdom".
* The submit button is clearly indicated and placed in a conventional position.
* Visual design of the input form uses the convention of "pill" styling to provide an attractive interface.
* Coherent styling is used to present the results list where the same "pill" styling is used.
* As well as in the styling and the design of user controls, UX is also considered in the design of the logic of the app. Javascript is used to ensure that results are presented in the most meaningful way. Cases of missing data and no data returned by the apis are handled by the logic to give the most value to users, with for example, informative messages rather than "null" values returned by the apis (for more details see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)).  
  

### Colour Scheme
The app colour scheme was based on a palette by [Colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/fff2ccffd966f4b183dfa67b) shown below,

![screenshot](documentation/colorhunt.png)

- `#000000` used for text colour.
- `##F4B183` used for site background colour.
- `#FFF2CC` used for input background colour.
- `#DFA67B` used for results list and button background colour.


### Typography



- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow) font was used for all site text.



## User Stories

|User action |
|--------|
| As a new site user, I would like to enter a name and country, so that I can find the average age and probable gender for the name for that country.
| As a new site user, I would like to have results for multiple requests shown as a list, so that I can make comparisons e.g. same name in different countries.
| As a new site user, I would like to have the ability to remove unwanted results from display, so that I can keep results uncluttered for recording in a screen shot for example.
| As a new user I would like to be able to find what proportion of people in the UK who are named Ashley are males?
| As a new user I would like to find the average age of people in USA who are named George?||



## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Name input field**
 
    - This feature allows a user to input any name they wish to check. Explanatory placeholder text is provided, the field is required and the onfocus attribute ensures one-click only is needed to clear the field for subsequent queries.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-name.png)


- **Country input select option field**

  -  This feature allows the user to select a country option from the ISO-3166-1: Alpha-2 Codes list of countries in dropdown form. This implementation removes chance of error when the user inputs a country. This field is also required.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-country.png)

- **Submit button**

    - The submit button is conventionally positioned and styled and submits a query once the required fields are selected.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-button.png)

- **Results record**

    - The individual results records show combined data returned from the two apis in a user-friendly format.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-record.png)

- **Results list**
    - Users can make multiple requests and the results are shown as a list. 
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-results.png)
- **"Warning" message**

    - Where neither api returns any data for a request, a user friendly warning is given.
    - ![screenshot](documentation/feature-warning.png)
- **User "tip"**

    - Once a user has a list of records from their search they can remove any records they do not want by clicking on the record. Users are informed of this functionality via an unobtrusive message in the user interface.
